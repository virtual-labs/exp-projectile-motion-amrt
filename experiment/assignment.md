## Assignment


<ol>
  <li>A brick is thrown upward from the top of a building at an angle of 25° to the horizontal with an initial speed of 15 m/s. If the brick is in flight for 3 seconds, how tall is the building?</li>

  <li>A fireman 50 m away from a burning building directs a stream of water from the ground-level fire hose at an angle of 30° above the horizontal. If the speed of the stream as it leaves the hose is 40 m/s, at what height will the stream of water hit the building?</li>

  <li>
    A stone is projected with a velocity of 5 m/s making an angle of 50° with the vertical.
    <ul>
      <li>Is there any other angle of projection in the X-Y plane that gives the same range?</li>
      <li>Calculate the range of the projectile.</li>
      <li>Draw the trajectory of the projectile.</li>
      <li>What happens to the time of flight and horizontal range if the motion is performed on the Moon?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>A boy wants to throw a ball through the window of his house to his friend across the street, which is 80 m wide. The window of the boy’s house is 10 m below the window of his friend’s house. How should he throw the ball?</li>

  <li>Prove that the gun will shoot three times as high when its angle of elevation is 60° as when it is 30°, but will cover the same horizontal range.</li>
